# The Gender Wage Gap

What is the difference in predicted wages between men and women with the same job-relevant
characteristics?
We analyze if there is a difference in the payment of men and women (gender wage gap). The
gender wage gap may partly reflect discrimination against women in the labor market or may partly
reflect a selection effect, namely that women are relatively more likely to take on occupations that
pay somewhat less (for example, school teaching).

# Data 

The data set we consider is from the March Supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey,
year 2015.
We select white non-hispanic individuals, aged 25 to 64 years, and working more
than 35 hours per week during at least 50 weeks of the year. We exclude self-employed workers;
individuals living in group quarters; individuals in the military, agricultural or private household
sectors; individuals with inconsistent reports on earnings and employment status; individuals with
allocated or missing information in any of the variables used in the analysis; and individuals with
hourly wage below 3.

The variable of interest Y is the hourly wage rate constructed as the ratio of the annual earnings
to the total number of hours worked, which is constructed in turn as the product of number of weeks
worked and the usual number of hours worked per week. In our analysis, we also focus on single
(never married) workers. The final sample is of size n = 5150.

# Problem Set

We will construct a prediction rule for hourly wage Y , which depends linearly on job-relevant
characteristics X. Consider the following log-linear regression model:

$$log(Y) = \beta'X + \epsilon$$
$$log(Y) = \beta_1 D + \beta_2'W + \epsilon$$

where $D$ is the indicator of being female (1 if female and 0 otherwise) and the $W$’s are controls
explaining variation in wages. Considering transformed wages by the logarithm, we are analyzing
the relative difference in the payment of men and women.

Our goals are

- Predict wages using various characteristics of workers.

- Assess the predictive performance using the (adjusted) sample MSE, the (adjusted) sample
R2, the out-of-sample MSE and R2.

We employ two different specifications for prediction:

1. Basic Model: X consists of a set of raw regressors (e.g. gender, experience, education,
occupation, industry and regional indicators).

2. Flexible Model: X consists of all raw regressors from the basic model plus occupation and
industry indicators transformations (e.g., exp2, exp3, exp4, occ2 and ind2) and additional
two-way interactions of polynomial in experience with other regressors. An example of a
regressor created through a two-way interaction is experience times the indicator of having
a college degree.

Using the Flexible Model, enables us to approximate the real relationship by a more complex
regression model and therefore to reduce the bias. The Flexible Model increases the range of
potential shapes of the estimated regression function. In general, flexible models often deliver
good prediction accuracy but give models which are harder to interpret.

Follow the next instructions:

- Focus on the subset of college-educated workers (scl, clg variables).
- Use appropiate plots (i.e. histograms, barplots, scatter plots, pie plots, etc.) to describe main
variables (wage, log-wage, sex, some high school, high school graduated, some college, college
graduated, advanced degree, experience)
- Run the Basic OLS model: lwage ∼ sex + exp1 + shs + hsg + mw + so + we + occ2 + ind2
- Run the Flexible OLS model: lwage ∼ sex+(exp1+exp2+exp3+exp4+shs+hsg +occ2+
ind2 + mw + so + we)2
- Compare the (adjusted) sample MSE, the (adjusted) sample R2, the out-of-sample MSE and
R2 of both models in a table.
- Make a coefficient plot for the sex variable in both models.

## Comments 

- Data wider format
- Training and testing data
- Instructions:
  - Instruccion 1: Si me centro (filtrar los datos SCL == 1 y CLG ==1) en esas 2 variables no podre continuar, en su totalidad del punto 2 al 6 , si lo hago los modelos tendran columnas con valores de 0 en las  variables relacionadas con la educacion. Por lo que lo hare con los datos totales.
  
  - Instrccion 3 y 4: Todos los datos
  - Instruccion 7: comparando medias
